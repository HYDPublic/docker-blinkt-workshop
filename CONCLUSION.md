## Workshop conclusion

Thanks for taking part in this Raspberry Pi and Docker workshop.

### Continue learning Docker

If you'd like to continue learning Docker for the Pi and maybe move on to the [Raspberry Pi Model 3](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-3) (a more powerful version with quad-core processor, 1GB RAM and Ethernet) then check out Docker Captain Alex Ellis' blog series:

* [Setting up a Pi Zero with Docker over a USB cable](http://blog.alexellis.io/docker-engine-in-your-pocket/)

* [Gotchas on ARM/Pi boards](http://blog.alexellis.io/5-things-docker-rpi/)

* [Raspberry Pi tag-series](http://blog.alexellis.io/tag/raspberry-pi/)

### Using the Pi at home

After you get home you can continue using your Pi Zero attached to your laptop or a PC with the red OTG cable, or you can purchase a WiFi / Ethernet USB dongle. 

> If you're using the Pi Zero W (newest edition) you won't need to purchase an additoinal dongle.

**Connectivity:**

* [Three port hub and ethernet](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/usb-multi-function-lan-adaptor)

* [Official Raspberry Pi WiFi Dongle](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/official-raspberry-pi-wifi-dongle)

* [Raspberry Pi Zero Adaptor Kit](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/zero-adaptor-kit)

*An adapter cable is needed to plug-in USB-A style devices*

**Power:**

If you want to power the Pi up without using an OTG cable then a regular phone charger will be fine if it supplies 1A or greater. If in doubt you can also buy the official Pi adapter:

* [Raspberry Pi Universal Power Supply](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-universal-power-supply)

**Stockists:**

In the US the best options for purchasing accessories would be Adafruit and Microcenter, but Pimoroni also ships world-wide.
